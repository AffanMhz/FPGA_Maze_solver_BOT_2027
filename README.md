## 🎯 Competition Overview

Welcome to our team repository for the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2025-26** by IIT Bombay! We are registered for the **MazeSolver Bot (MB)** theme, where we're developing an FPGA-powered agricultural warehouse navigator using Verilog HDL and custom RISC-V CPU architecture.

### 🚀 Our Competition Journey

As participants in eYRC 2025-26, we're embarking on a **7-8 month learning adventure** to solve real-world agricultural challenges. Our mission is to design and implement a bot that can navigate dynamic warehouse environments while collecting critical environmental data for smart farming applications.
