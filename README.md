# FPGA Maze Solver BOT 2027

"Learning While Competing in Agricultural Warehouse Navigation"

This is our team repository for participating in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2025-26 by IIT Bombay. We are registered for the MazeSolver Bot (MB) theme, where we'll develop an FPGA-powered agricultural warehouse navigator using Verilog HDL and custom RISC-V CPU architecture.

## Our Competition Journey

As participants in eYRC 2025-26, we're embarking on a 7-8 month learning adventure to solve real-world agricultural challenges. Our mission is to design and implement a bot that can navigate dynamic warehouse environments while collecting critical environmental data for smart farming applications.

## What We're Building

* Dynamic Maze Navigation System → Real-time path adaptation in changing warehouses
* Environmental Sensing Platform → Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring
* Custom RISC-V CPU on FPGA → Complete system implementation in Verilog
* Agricultural Data Intelligence → Smart farming data collection and transmission
